# Roadmap

The canonical roadmap lives in [docs/product/SCOPE_AND_ROADMAP.md](docs/product/SCOPE_AND_ROADMAP.md).

**Last reviewed:** 2026-10-05
**Current phase:** Phase 3 — multi-session runtime
**Implementation state:** executable Rust pre-alpha; Phase 1, Phase 2A–2C, Phase 2D1–2D3D, the real-binary closure smoke and the explicit ChatGPT integration packaging gate are merged
**Release state:** no production-supported release
**Next gate:** Phase 3 begins with multi-session runtime isolation: independent application sessions/projects/resources/capabilities plus adversarial cross-session tests proving one session cannot use another session's leases/jobs/state. Phase 2D3 is complete after the 2026-10-05 real ChatGPT Desktop smoke validated status → exact-head fast-forward → status → stale-precondition rejection on a disposable repository.

The first real Windows developer smoke passed on 2026-10-04 against the Phase 2D2 file/Git-read surface. The later 2026-10-05 disposable-repository ChatGPT Desktop smoke completed the Phase 2D3 exact-head integration gate end-to-end. These are integration/security validations, not production-readiness claims.

The user-scoped Windows quick installer, MCP doctor, uninstaller and tag-driven prerelease bundle workflow have also been pulled forward as developer-preview Phase 5 groundwork. No public release has been tagged yet, so the repository remains pre-alpha with release state `none`.

Roadmap status is maintained with the repository. Every milestone change must update `STATUS.md`; user-visible changes update `CHANGELOG.md`; architecture/security changes update the owning canonical document and an ADR when a decision changes.

A phase is complete only when its acceptance/security gates pass. Calendar dates are planning aids, not completion criteria.
