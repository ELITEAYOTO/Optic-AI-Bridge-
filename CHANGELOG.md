# Changelog

All notable project changes are recorded here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Canonical product, architecture, security, specification, engineering, operations and research documentation.
- Multi-session and same-repository worktree isolation design.
- Deterministic policy/capability model.
- Bounded output and crash-recovery design.
- Living roadmap, project status, security policy and maintenance policy.
- Security invariants and AI-native safety architecture.
- ADRs for application-owned session handles, action envelopes and source/sink containment.
- Phase 0 Rust workspace with `optic-bridge-core`, `optic-bridge-policy` and `optic-bridge-app`.
- Opaque random SessionHandle, TaskLeaseId and ActionId primitives with redacted Debug output.
- Strict workspace-relative path primitive and BLAKE3 content versions.
- Explicit ResourceBudget/HardLimits types where zero is never interpreted as unlimited.
- Typed ActionEnvelope, SessionGrant and TaskLease.
- Initial deterministic PolicyEngine with negative security tests.
- Windows/Linux CI and cargo-deny dependency policy.

### Changed
- Architecture updated for MCP 2026-07-28 stateless protocol semantics.
- Security goal changed from impossible “100% secure” wording to testable invariants plus defense in depth.
- Project lifecycle advanced from documentation-only to executable Phase 0 foundation.

### Security
- Model/repository/process output explicitly treated as untrusted for authorization.
- Transport limits must be enforced by Optic AI Bridge even when an upstream SDK also has limits.
- Initial policy rejects cross-session leases, missing leases for mutating/process actions, stale policy epochs, resource-budget overflow, normal policy mutation and privilege elevation.
