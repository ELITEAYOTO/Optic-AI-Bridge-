# Changelog

All notable project changes are recorded here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Canonical product, architecture, security, specification, engineering, operations and research documentation.
- Multi-session and same-repository worktree isolation design.
- Deterministic policy/capability model.
- Bounded output and crash-recovery design.
- Living roadmap, project status, security policy and maintenance policy.
- Security invariants and AI-native safety architecture.
- ADRs for application-owned session handles, action envelopes and source/sink containment.
- Phase 0 Rust workspace with `optic-bridge-core`, `optic-bridge-policy` and `optic-bridge-app`.
- Opaque random SessionHandle, TaskLeaseId and ActionId primitives with redacted Debug output.
- Strict workspace-relative path primitive and BLAKE3 content versions.
- Explicit ResourceBudget/HardLimits types where zero is never interpreted as unlimited.
- Typed ActionEnvelope, SessionGrant and TaskLease.
- Initial deterministic PolicyEngine with negative security tests.
- Windows/Linux CI and cargo-deny dependency policy.
- Phase 0.1 typed `Effect` model so target/precondition/reversibility semantics are derived from one valid variant rather than independently combinable fields.
- Explicit `ExpectedState::{Absent, Content}` mutation preconditions and validated Git object ids for integration preconditions.
- Scope-bearing task leases for workspace prefixes, repositories, process executables and network destinations.
- Monotonic runtime deadline primitive for session/task expiry checks.
- Security tests for lease-scope escape and process-network authorization.
- Phase 1 `optic-bridge-runtime` crate for application-owned runtime services independent of MCP.
- Real monotonic `StdClock` adapter and revocable/expiring `SessionRegistry`.
- `TransportGuard` enforcing request/response byte ceilings, request deadlines and bounded concurrent requests independently of SDK defaults.
- Bounded read-only filesystem service for chunked `fs_read` and deterministic paginated `fs_list`.
- Hard filesystem read/list/scan ceilings and transport concurrency/request-duration ceilings in `HardLimits`.
- Runtime tests covering session revocation/expiry, transport byte/concurrency/deadline bounds, filesystem chunking/pagination and directory scan ceilings.

### Changed
- Architecture updated for MCP 2026-07-28 stateless protocol semantics.
- Security goal changed from impossible “100% secure” wording to testable invariants plus defense in depth.
- Project lifecycle advanced from documentation-only to executable Phase 0 foundation, Phase 0.1 contract hardening and Phase 1 runtime foundation.
- Process network access now requires NetworkAccess at both session and task-lease level plus an explicit network lease scope.
- Workspace prefix authorization is segment-aware (`src` does not authorize `src2`).
- Existing read-only filesystem targets are canonicalized and verified to remain under the canonical workspace root before I/O.

### Security
- Model/repository/process output explicitly treated as untrusted for authorization.
- Transport limits must be enforced by Optic AI Bridge even when an upstream SDK also has limits.
- Initial policy rejects cross-session leases, missing leases for mutating/process actions, stale policy epochs, resource-budget overflow, normal policy mutation and privilege elevation.
- Task leases now deny mutations/process/network operations outside their explicit scope.
- Network permission is no longer inherited from a broad session capability alone for leased process execution.
- Phase 1 runtime state remains application-owned rather than MCP-session-owned.
- Directory listing has both a page bound and an independent deterministic scan ceiling, preventing apparently paginated calls from becoming unbounded directory scans.
- Filesystem reads allocate at most the caller request bounded by the compiled per-call hard ceiling.
